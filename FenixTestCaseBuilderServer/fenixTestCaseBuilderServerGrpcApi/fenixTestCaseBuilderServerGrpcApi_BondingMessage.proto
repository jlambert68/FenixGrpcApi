// All messages in this file is used to define a Bond, which is the object that binds TestInstructions and TestInstructionContainers together
// A bond can be replaced by a TestInstruction or a TestInstructionContainer
// Bonds are off different type, e.g. can be replaced or can not be replaced
// TI = TestInstruction (A normal TI always have the following structure: B2-TI-B2
// TIC = TestInstructionContainer (A normal TIC always have the following structure: B2-TIC-B2
// B0 = Bond with only one connection, which  is used for New empty TestCase. Can not be replaced. Exists only within pre-created TIC
// B1 = Bond that can not be replaced. Used to ensure that certain pre-created 'stuff' will be executed first or last. User can't change that. Exists only within pre-created TIC
// B2 = Bond that can be replaced by TI, TIC
// B3 = Bond with zero connection, can be replaced by TI, TIC or B2
//
// B0 = Bond with zero connection. This is the base for any TestCase: "B0"
// B1 = Bond with one connection. Use for starting a new TestCase and is only found i pre-created TestInstructionContainers : "B1-TIC(B10)-B1", "B1-TIC(?)-B1"
//
// B10 = Bond with zero connections which appear as only object in a new TestInstructionContainer: "TIC(B11-TIC(B10)-B11)" or "-B12-TIC(B10)-B12-"
// B11 = Bond with one connection which appear as first or last element inside a TestInstructionContainer when there are at least one element, TI or TIC: "TIC(B11-X..X-B11)"
// B12 = Bond with two connections which connects TestInstructions or TestInstructionContainers: "TI-B12-TI", "TIC-B12-TIC", "TI-B12-TIC", "TIC-B12-TI"
